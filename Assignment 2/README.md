  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This project explores the effectiveness of various deep learning architectures for image classification tasks as a proxy for facial recognition systems. Experiments were conducted using the CIFAR-10 dataset to compare performance across different network types and regularization techniques. The results provide insights into why convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominate modern facial recognition solutions.</p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate fully connected deep neural networks (DNNs) vs. convolutional neural networks (CNNs).</li>
    <li>Analyze the effects of hyperparameters (batch size, number of nodes, etc.).</li>
    <li>Investigate the impact of regularization methods (dropout, batch normalization, L2 regularization).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <p>The experiments use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 labeled color images (32x32 pixels), spread across 10 classes. It serves as a practical stand-in for more complex facial recognition datasets.</p>

  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple DNNs achieved <strong>~50% accuracy</strong>.</li>
    <li>CNNs with proper regularization exceeded <strong>82% test accuracy</strong>.</li>
    <li>Regularization (especially L2 + batch norm + dropout) significantly reduces overfitting.</li>
    <li>The best-performing model was a 6-layer CNN (Model 5b) with a test accuracy of <strong>82.68%</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
