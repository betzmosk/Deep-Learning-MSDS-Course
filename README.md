  <h2>Repository Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/betzmosk/Deep-Learning-MSDS-Course/tree/main/Assignment%201">Assignment 1 – MNIST Digit Classification</a></strong><br>
      Explores the performance of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) on the MNIST dataset. 
      Includes PCA/t-SNE visualizations and a Random Forest baseline. Various network depths and activations are tested.
    </li><br>

    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/betzmosk/Deep-Learning-MSDS-Course/tree/main/Assignment%202">Assignment 2 – CNNs vs. DNNs for Image Classification</a></strong><br>
      Compares fully connected deep networks with convolutional neural networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
      Investigates the impact of architecture depth, batch size, and regularization strategies on performance.
    </li><br>

    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/betzmosk/Deep-Learning-MSDS-Course/tree/main/Assignment%203">Assignment 3 – Neural Architectures for Text Classification</a></strong><br>
      Applies and compares a wide range of NLP models—GRUs, LSTMs, RNNs, CNNs, and DNNs—for intent classification on the AG News dataset.
      Evaluates the effect of vocabulary size, token representation, and dropout on model generalization.
    </li><br>

    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/betzmosk/Deep-Learning-MSDS-Course/tree/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Hate%20Speech%20Detector">Final Project – Hate Speech Detection with Deep Learning</a></strong><br>
      Develops a deep learning pipeline to classify hate speech using the HateXplain dataset.
      Combines LSTM models with transfer learning via DistilBERT embeddings, and includes thorough evaluation metrics and class imbalance handling.
